There are several branches which belong to each member. The develop branch is the branch where we tried to merge the application. The Repository also contains the two-phases reports. The implementation of the some subsystem functionality are not working because of the issue encountered with our data system. Trying to solve this consumed most of our time. Each subsystem can be run by running the following files:

Login and Register:
/LoginRegisterPage/loginRegisterCode.py

Manager Dashboard:
/ManagerDashboard/ManagerDashboard.py

Visitor Homepage:
/Customer_Visitor_Homepage/visitor.py

Registered Customer Homepage:
/Customer_Visitor_Homepage/registered.py

Forum:
ForumPage/Forum.py

Delivery Company Dashboard:
/StoreClerk_DeliveryCompany_Dashboard/delivery_main.py

Store Clerk Dashboard:
/StoreClerk_DeliveryCompany_Dashboard/clerk_main.py

App Admin Dashboard:
/AdminDashboard/Admin.py

Notes: The system may not work the same way as our local files.
